# Is London Really as Rainy as the Movies Make It Out to Be? ðŸ¤”

This project investigates London's rainy reputation by analysing rainfall metrics across major cities. Using data visualisation and statistical metrics, we explore whether London's weather aligns with its portrayal in popular culture.

## Description

This analysis examines rainfall data for London and other major cities to determine if London is truly as rainy as often depicted in movies. By analysing metrics such as the number of rainy days, monthly total rainfall, and average rain intensity, we gain insights into the reality of London's weather.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure the following:
1. Python is installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install required Python packages using the following code in terminal

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

After installing the necessary packages above, open `code/NB01 - Data Collection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to collect and process rainfall data, then proceed to `code/NB02 - Simple Data Analysis.ipynb` for data analysis and visualisation. The notebooks are structured to guide you through data loading, processing, visualisation, and conclusions step-by-step.

## Python Scripts

The project includes Python scripts located in the `scripts/` folder. These scripts streamline the data collection process by organizing reusable functions and enabling data collection through command-line execution.

1. **data_collection_utils.py**: This script contains reusable functions that support data collection, including:
   - `get_lat_lon(country_code, city_name)`: Retrieves latitude and longitude for a given city.
   - `build_url(latitude, longitude, start_date, end_date)`: Constructs the API URL for retrieving weather data based on city coordinates and date range.
   - `get_historical_data(country_code, city_name, start_date, end_date)`: Fetches historical rainfall data for a specified city and date range.

   These functions make it easy to modularize and maintain the data collection process.

2. **data_collection_script.py**: This is a standalone script designed to collect rainfall data for a specified city and date range. It can be run directly from the terminal and uses command-line arguments to specify parameters, making it flexible for different cities and timeframes. (shown below)

## How to Use the Data Collection Script

The data collection script allows you to gather rainfall data for a specific city and time period. You can run it from the terminal using the following command:

```bash
python scripts/data_collection_script.py <country_code> <city_name> --start_date <start_date> --end_date <end_date> --output_file <output_file>
```

- <country_code>: The country code for the city (e.g., "SG" for Singapore).
- <city_name>: The name of the city (e.g., "Singapore").
- <start_date>: The start date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Defaults to 2023-01-01.
- <end_date>: (Optional) The end date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Defaults to 2023-12-31.
- --output_file: (Optional) Path to save the collected data as a JSON file. You can save it as 'data/singapore_2023.json' for example.
Defaults to ../data/multicity_historical.json.

## Methodology

### Data Source
The data used in this analysis was sourced from the [Open-Meteo Historical Weather API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api), which provides weather-related metrics for various global cities, including London, Cairo, Singapore, and more.

### Data Collection Strategy
In this project, we used the **Historical Weather Data** endpoint from the Open-Meteo API:

| Endpoint         | URL starts with                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| [Historical Weather Data](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api) | `https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive` |

The objective is to assess the raininess of **London, UK** relative to other cities with varied climates. We collected historical precipitation data for the entire year of 2023 to enable a detailed comparison of annual rain patterns.

- The `data_collection_script.py` script uses functions from `data_collection_utils.py` to automate data collection. By specifying a city and date range, the script retrieves historical weather data and saves it to a JSON file.


#### Cities Selected for Comparison:
1. **London, UK** â€“ The main city of interest, often portrayed as rainy.
2. **Singapore** â€“ Known for its tropical climate with high annual rainfall.
3. **Cairo, Egypt** â€“ Represents a dry climate with very low annual rainfall.
4. **Buenos Aires, Argentina** â€“ A moderate climate with regular seasonal rainfall.
5. **Mumbai, India** â€“ Known for very high rainfall, particularly during the monsoon season.

#### Data Collection Scope
For each city, the following data was retrieved for 2023:
- **Daily Precipitation** (`precipitation_sum`) to measure total rainfall.

## Metrics and Results

### Metrics Analysed
This analysis uses key rainfall metrics to evaluate Londonâ€™s reputation as a rainy city and compare it with other cities:

- **Number of Rainy Days**: Evaluates the frequency of rainy days in London versus other cities.
- **Monthly Total Rainfall**: Assesses the volume of rain London receives over time.
- **Average Rain Intensity**: Gauges whether Londonâ€™s rain tends to be light or heavy.

These metrics provide a balanced view of the frequency, volume and intensity of rainfall, helping to understand London's weather patterns accurately.

### Results & Visualisations
Each metric is visualised to highlight Londonâ€™s rain characteristics:

- **Figure 1: Number of Rainy Days - Bar Chart**: London has frequent, light rain, contributing to its "rainy" reputation without significant downpours.
- **Figure 2: Monthly Total Rainfall - Line Graph**: London experiences a steady rainfall trend throughout the year, showing a consistent but moderate volume of rain.
- **Figure 3: Average Rain Intensity - Bar Chart**: Londonâ€™s rain is generally light, which differs from the intense rain often depicted in movies.

Detailed visualisations for these findings are available in the Jupyter Notebook named 'NB02 - Simple Data Analysis.ipynb'.


## Conclusion

The analysis shows that London experiences frequent rain, with rainfall on 62.4% of the days in 2023. While Londonâ€™s rain is generally lighter and less intense compared to tropical cities, its consistent, moderate rainfall supports its reputation as a rainy city. 

Overall, we conclude that Londonâ€™s rainy image is justified based on the frequency and consistency of rainfall, though it is not as heavy as often depicted in movies.


## Further Exploration

Future analysis could explore additional weather metrics, like temperature and humidity, for a fuller picture of London's climate. Another option is to compare seasonal rainfall patterns or examine trends in rain intensity over the years to see if London's rainy reputation is changing.
