# Is London Really as Rainy as the Movies Make It Out to Be? ðŸ¤”

This project investigates London's rainy reputation by analysing rainfall metrics across major cities. Using data visualisation and statistical metrics, we explore whether London's weather aligns with its portrayal in popular culture.

## Description

This analysis examines rainfall data for London and other major cities to determine if London is truly as rainy as often depicted in movies. By analysing metrics such as the number of rainy days, monthly total rainfall, and average rain intensity, we gain insights into the reality of London's weather.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed. Install the necessary packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## Project Structure and How to Run

The repository is organised as follows:

```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ multicity_historical.json    # JSON file containing historical rainfall data across multiple cities
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ world_cities.csv             # CSV file with metadata or coordinates of cities involved in the study
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                        # Documentation file explaining the project, setup, and usage
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt                 # List of dependencies needed to run the project
```

To run the project, open `code/NB01 - Data Collection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to collect and process rainfall data, then proceed to `code/NB02 - Simple Data Analysis.ipynb` for data analysis and visualisation. The notebooks are structured to guide you through data loading, processing, visualisation, and conclusions step-by-step.

## Methodology

### Data Source
The data used in this analysis was sourced from the [Open-Meteo Historical Weather API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api), which provides monthly rainfall metrics for various global cities, including London, Cairo, Singapore, and more.

### Metrics Analysed
- **Number of Rainy Days**: To evaluate the frequency of rainy days in London versus other cities.
- **Monthly Total Rainfall**: To assess the volume of rain London receives over time.
- **Average Rain Intensity**: To gauge whether Londonâ€™s rain tends to be light or heavy.

These metrics provide a balanced view of both the frequency and intensity of rainfall, which helps in understanding London's weather patterns accurately.

## Results & Visualisations

- **Figure 1: Number of Rainy Days - Bar Chart**: London has frequent, light rain, contributing to its "rainy" reputation without significant downpours.
- **Figure 2: Monthly Total Rainfall - Line Graph**: London experiences a steady rainfall trend through the year, showing a consistent but moderate volume of rain.
- **Figure 3: Average Rain Intensity - Bar Chart**: Londonâ€™s rain is generally light, which differs from the intense rain often depicted in movies.

Detailed visualisations for these findings are available in the Jupyter Notebook named 'NB02 - Simple Data Analysis.ipynb'.

## Conclusion

This analysis shows that while London does experience frequent rainy days, the rain tends to be light and less intense than often depicted in movies. London's "rainy" image is more due to the frequency of rain rather than its intensity or total volume.

## Further Exploration

Future analysis could explore additional weather metrics, like temperature and humidity, for a fuller picture of London's climate. Another option is to compare seasonal rainfall patterns or examine trends in rain intensity over the years to see if London's rainy reputation is changing.
